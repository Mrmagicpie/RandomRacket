<h1 align="center">Shell Bot</h1>

This bot allows you to run shell commands in Discord. It uses powershell or bash based on the operating system.

**Warning:** This will run any shell code given with no code checks. It is meant for a limited amount of "bot owners" specified at the top of the code.  I, obviously, assume no liability for stupidity.
